- Create a repository
    git init - run the code in order to create a git repo from that directory
- add the file to the repository and commit
    git add file.html - 
    git commit -m 'First Commit'
- Check the status 
- this command checks the status and reports that there's nothing to commit
- meaning the repository stores the current state 
- Git  knows that the file has changed, but these changes are not yet committed to the repo
    git status
- Adding the changes
- Changes to the file has been staged. This means that git knows about the change, but it is
not permanent until it is commited.
    git status
    git add file.html
    git commit -m "haha"

- Add project to github
    git remote add origin remoteAddURL
    git push -u origin master
